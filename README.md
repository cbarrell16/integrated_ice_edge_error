# integrated_ice_edge_error
Calculate Integrated Ice Edge Error (IIEE) metric to evaluate sea ice prediction in Met Office Unified Model (GC3.1) using satellite sea ice concentration data from AMSR2 and OSTIA.

The notebook illustrates the development of the code and the steps taken to regrid products and perform computations. Simple plots are produced along the way to check the data processing. Results are output as netcdf. Model and satellite data are not provided as access is not freely public.
